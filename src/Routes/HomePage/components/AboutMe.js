            I'm a final year Software Engineering student at The University of
            Technology Sydney. University has taught me how to approach
            and solve problems using agile decision-making metholodigies as well
            teaching me how to work effectively in a team environment. My
            internship experience at large, multi-industry and emerging companies,
            including Siemens and OneWiFi Australia, has provided me a platform
            to apply what i've learnt at University to real-world scenarios such as
            large-scale network and control system design, implementation and testing.
