            At university we take multiple studio classes for software
            engineering which focuses on web development.  Iâ€™ve enjoyed these
            classes as it allowed me to grow my technical skills and use
            technologies commonly used by major companies.  Aside from the
            technical growth I also experienced the software development
            life cycle from receiving the requirements from the client,
            planning, and analysing to implementing and maintaining the product.

            I also learnt how to work in an agile framework using scrum to
            develop and deliver the highest value product to the client.
            I have received two high distinctions and one distinction so far
            for these subjects.
