          <p>
          Most of my internship at Siemens Energy was spent at a power station
          where I was a part of the commissioning team.  The team was responsible
          for testing signals for the newly upgraded distributed control system.
          My primary role was desk technician where I made sure that signals,
          alarms, and faults on the HMI (human-machine interface) displayed
          correctly when triggered by a field technician.  I also helped the
          network engineering team set-up and test the multiple servers and
          clients to allow the control system to receive field data.  I moved
          into the return to service team when the commissioning team completed
          all signal tests.  This is where I communicated regularly with the
          customer and participated in multiple meetings to get the plant
          running with the new control system.

          When I wasnâ€™t on site, I was building an energy output dashboard for
          the Siemens Energy Sydney office.   The premise of the dashboard was
          to display the energy output of Asia-Pacific power stations that use
          the Siemens Energy distributed control system.  The technology I used
           included Python, specifically pandas and NumPy libraries for web
           scraping and data manipulation.  I also used JavaScript, CSS and an
           open-source JavaScript library called Leaflet to display an
          interactive map.
